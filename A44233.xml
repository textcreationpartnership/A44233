            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT having been my Fate to Live in times that have been ſo Troubleſome (though not in <hi>England</hi>) put me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Inquiry from what Natural Cauſes theſe many Calamities that have attended <hi>Europe</hi> for this laſt paſt 10 years, and having examined many Authors concerning the Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and found that their Catalogue of Conjunctions was groſly falſe, having had a light of their fulneſs by Mr. <hi>Edling</hi>'s <hi>Nuncius Syderens,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by him 1664. I took upon me to Calculate the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral years of their Conjunction from the <hi>Caroline</hi> Tables of Mr. <hi>Thomas Street,</hi> and have Framed a Table thereof for 3958 Years before the coming of Chriſt our Saviour, until the year of our Lord God 1702; and have alſo Framed a Table from the ſame <hi>Caroline</hi> Table of the Mutations of the <hi>Aphelions</hi> of the Planets, for many years to come, that thereby the Artiſt might have a ſure Foundation, for want of which Aſtrology has been very lame. I have alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented you with all the Comets, that have been obſerved ſince 1602. with a new method how to judge of the time of their Effects, and have examined the truth by Examples by paſt, by which I found out the way. I have alſo preſented you with a Speculum of the Directions of the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction 1603. and the New Star 1604. and have alſo ſhewed a way how the leſſer Conjunction may be directed for to find the time of the Accidents. I have alſo preſented
<pb facs="tcp:42780:3"/>you with a Speculum of the <hi>Conjunction</hi> 1663. and of the <hi>Conjunction</hi> 1682. Likewiſe with a Table of all the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions</hi> and <hi>Oppoſitions</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars:</hi> And alſo with a Table of all the <hi>Eclipſes</hi> of the <hi>Luminaries</hi> from the year 1683, to the year 1701. with a Table of the Aſpect that <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> makes till the year 1701. all which Tables coſt me a great deal of time, for the Table of the ſeveral <hi>Conjunctions</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> coſt me 6 Months trouble at my ſpare times. So likewiſe have I given a probable Conjecture of the Triple <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> 1682, and 1683. and the two Comets that have appeared laſt, <hi>(viz)</hi> 1680, and 1682. And I have alſo preſented you with my probable Conjecture of each year from the year 1682, to 1700. In which I have as near as I could, kept cloſe to the Rules of Aſtrology, yet it is poſſible in ſome things for want of Preſidents, I may not hit juſt the time, but I hope the Ingenious will paſs by theſe things, knowing that very few of the Ancients have treated any thing to the purpoſe of <hi>Conjunctions;</hi> many of the things that I preſent you withall, are wholly new. I have alſo Annexed the <hi>Hyroglyphicks</hi> of <hi>Noſtradamus,</hi> publiſh'd by Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> 1651. and have taken the pains to place them right and in order (for Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> placed them wrong and out of order) beſides, I have added a many more which relate to the Mutations of <hi>Europe,</hi> the next 20 years, all which labour and pains (which I will aſſure you was not ſmall) I preſent to the World, hoping it may meet with the kind acceptance of the Ingenious of this Age; which if it do, is all the reward I expect, and it will oblige me to make a further Inquiry into Aſtrology; but in the mean time</p>

            <p>THE Aphelions of the Planets is no more than a fixt point in the Ellipſis of the Planets Motion, which when any Planet is in Conjunction with that Point, then are they in their furtheſt diſtance from the <hi>Sun,</hi> and are then the floweſt in their Motion; now the Motions of the Aphelions of the Planets, is not above 48 Seconds in a Year, and that is cauſed by the preceſſion of the Equinoctial, by which means it moves through the 12 Signs but once in 27000 Years; this Motion of all Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the ſloweſt; and therefore the Change of the Aphelion of any of the Primary Planets is thought by thoſe that have been Learned in <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> to cauſe great Mutation in the World; but by reaſon that <hi>Aſtronomy</hi> hath been in former Ages very lame (as may be ſeen by any that do make but an enquiry into it) hath cauſed the famous Maſters of this Science in former Ages to erre, for moſt, if not all Tables of <hi>Aſtronomy</hi> diſagree in this very point, about the Motion of the Aphelion, but the beſt Tables as yet extant, are the <hi>Carolina</hi> Tables of <hi>Thomas Street,</hi> from which Tables I have framed a Table of the Motion of the Aphelions of the Primary Planets, out of one Sign into another, for ſome Years to come.</p>

            <p>All thoſe that are furniſhed with Hiſtory may compare former times with the Mutations of the Aphelions of the Planets, and find a great ſatisfaction therein; for 389 Years before the Floud, <hi>Saturn</hi> changed his Aphelion out of <hi>Libra</hi> into <hi>Scorpio</hi> a Watry Sign, and 516 Years before the Floud <hi>Mars</hi> changed his Aphelion out of <hi>Gemini</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Cancer</hi> a Watry Sign: Now no Planet except <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> did change their Aphelion near thoſe times; and when <hi>Mars</hi> changed his Aphelion out of <hi>Cancer</hi> into <hi>Leo</hi> 123 Years afterwards began the <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchy, and the Conqueſt of the known part of the World by <hi>Alexander the Great;</hi> and but 4 Years before the Conqueſt of the World, <hi>Saturn</hi> changed his Aphelion out of <hi>Scorpio</hi> into <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitary;</hi> but by reaſon the Aphelions of the Primary Planets are of ſo ſlow a Motion, <hi>(viz.)</hi> are no leſs than 2250 Years a going out of one Sign into another, and to determine any Judgment from their Motion, is very uncertain, becauſe <hi>Aſtronomers</hi> differ ſo much about their places: For <hi>Spineus</hi> will have the Aphelion of <hi>Mars</hi> to have paſſed out of <hi>Leo</hi> into <hi>Virgo</hi> in the Year 1630; and by the <hi>Rudol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> Tables not till the Year 1650; and by the <hi>Caroline</hi> Table (which I hold to be moſt exact) not till 1691, a conſiderable difference
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42780:9"/>of time between theſe Tables: however ſuch manner of Accidents will certainly happen, as <hi>Spineus</hi> makes mention of in his <hi>Cataſtrophe mundi (viz.)</hi> That there ſhould be great War and Bloudſhed all over the whole World; even to the deſtruction of Monarchy in ſeveral Kingdoms, and reduce all to an <hi>Ariſtocratical</hi> [or <hi>Democratica</hi>] <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrity,</hi> both in the Government of the Commonwealth and Church; but e'r that can be effected <hi>Omnia nutu unius Regentur:</hi> So ſaid <hi>Cardanus</hi> long ſince.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Conjunctions of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Learned in <hi>Aſtrology</hi> do ſay, that there are three kinds of Conjunction, which they term <hi>Magna</hi> or <hi>great,</hi> and <hi>medium</hi> or <hi>mean</hi> or <hi>middle, minimam</hi> or <hi>leaſt</hi> of all, this was the Opinion of <hi>Cardan, Noibod, Origanus, Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben,</hi> and ſince their Death <hi>Campanella,</hi> they likewiſe ſay, that when <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> make their firſt Conjunction in <hi>Aries,</hi> that ſhould be counted the greateſt of all; but there has been none ſuch never ſince the beginning of time, as was very well noted by Mr. <hi>Edling,</hi> in his Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> 1663, and as any one may ſee that will be pleaſed but to calculate their entrance into the fiery Trigons; but note, that which I mean by a great Conjunction, is when <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> make their firſt Conjunction in the Fiery Trigon, which Trigon is <hi>Aries, Leo, Sagitary,</hi> and their firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction at the entrance of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in this Trigon, hath always been in <hi>Sagitary:</hi> The reaſon the Antients hath fondly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> made ſometimes their Conjunction in <hi>Aries</hi> or <hi>Leo,</hi> I conceive to be for want of good Tables to Calculate their Motions.</p>
            <p>Now all Modern Authors call that the <hi>great</hi> Conjunction of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> which fall in the Fiery Trigon, <hi>(viz.) Aries, Leo, Sagitarius,</hi> and thoſe the <hi>mean</hi> which fall in any of the other Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicities after their firſt entrance into it; Now the firſt Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> fell in <hi>Sagitarius,</hi> and that was 3958 Years before Chriſt, and they continued their Conjunction out of <hi>Sagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarius</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:42780:10"/>into <hi>Leo</hi> and thence into <hi>Aries,</hi> until they had made 10 Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions in the Fiery Trigon, and then they made their firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction in <hi>Virgo</hi> of the Earthy <hi>Trigon,</hi> and that was 3759 Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the coming of Chriſt, and ſo continued their ſeveral Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions out of <hi>Virgo</hi> into <hi>Taurus,</hi> and thence into <hi>Capricorn,</hi> until they had made 10 more Conjunctions, and then they made their firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction in the Airy Triplicity in <hi>Gemini,</hi> and that was 3560 Years before the coming of Chriſt, and having made 10 Conjunctions in that Triplicity, they made their firſt Conjunction in <hi>Piſces,</hi> of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Triplicity, and that was 3361 Years before the coming of Chriſt, and after having made Ten Meetings in that Triplicity, did make their ſecond meeting in the fiery <hi>Trigon</hi> in <hi>Sagitarius.</hi> 3164 before the coming of Chriſt: So have they continued their Conjunctions out of the fiery Triplicity into the Earthy, and from thence into the Airy, and ſo into the Watry, and from thence into the Fiery again, making no more nor leſs than 10 Conjunctions in each Triplicity, and the firſt in the Fiery hath always been in <hi>Sagitarius,</hi> and the firſt hath been in <hi>Virgo,</hi> of the Earthy, and in <hi>Gemini</hi> in the Airy, and <hi>Piſces</hi> in the Watry. Indeed Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> tells us in his <hi>Prophetical Merline p.</hi> 3. that the firſt Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the Watry Triplicity, was in <hi>Cancer,</hi> but by Calculation any one may find that their firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction was in <hi>Piſces,</hi> and likewiſe he doth tell you, that if you may believe <hi>John Ganivetus,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Amicus Medicorum,</hi> that upon their ſeventh Return into the Watry Triplicity, that they made their firſt Conjunction in <hi>Scorpio,</hi> but by Calculation their firſt meeting was in <hi>Piſces.</hi> 20 Years before Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> in his <hi>Anglicus</hi> 1677, publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed a Table of all the Conjunctions of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> from the Creation of the World; but by Calculation I find that to be groſly falſe, and ſo likewiſe is that Table publiſhed 1680, and that it may be ſeen how far they be wide from the Truth, I have Publiſhed here a Table of all the Conjunctions for 3958 Years before the coming of Chriſt.</p>

If in <hi>Sagitarius,</hi> the World begins to be weary of former Wars, and upon ſmall intreaty, will be ready to hearken to Peace; ſome Ancient Family is a decaying, and a new one repairing and exalted.

               <p>Note thoſe Families, Kingdoms, Cities, Towns and Forts, and all manner of Men that had their Riſe under the Airy Triplicity <hi>(Viz.)

               <p>Thus have Authors write concerning the Conjunctions of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> through the ſour Triplicities, but they mean when a great Conjunction happens to be in any of thoſe Signs which can never be in all of them, for there cannot be a great Conjunction in neither <hi>Aries</hi> nor <hi>Leo</hi> of the Fiery Triplicity, nor in <hi>Cancer,</hi> nor <hi>Scotpio</hi> of the Watry, nor in <hi>Libra</hi> and <hi>Aquarius</hi> of the Airy, nor in <hi>Taurus</hi> and <hi>Capricorn</hi> of the Earthy; but I conceive the former Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſms to be general: Now as the great Conjunctions of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> have always been in <hi>Sagitarius,</hi> the <hi>mean Conjunctions</hi> are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thoſe that fall upon the Change, out of one Triplicity into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that is, when <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> have made all their Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Fiery Triplicity, and they come to make their firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction in the Earthy, which hath always been in <hi>Virgo,</hi> this we call a <hi>mean Conjunction,</hi> and ſuch a Conjunction happeneth once in 199 Years; but the <hi>great Conjunction</hi> hapdeneth but once in 794 years, and thoſe which we call <hi>leſſer Conjunctions</hi> are they which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen once in 20 years.</p>
               <p>Now foraſmuch as a <hi>great Conjunction</hi> happeneth but once in 794 years; therefore is the Influence of that Conjunction of the greateſt force, and doth continue the longeſt of all of them <hi>(viz.)</hi> 794 years until they come to be conjoyn'd in the ſame Triplicity; now accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the good or evil Poſitions of the reſt of the Planets, and the ſtrength of the Planets conjoyn'd, is a Judgment drawn.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:42780:14"/>
               <p>Likewiſe is the <hi>mean Conjunction</hi> of great force, for that happening but once in 199 years, doth alſo continue their influence untill the end of that, and about the middle of that time is the influence at the higheſt, and afterwards will it decline. Now are we not far from the middle of the influence of ſuch a <hi>Conjunction,</hi> at which time there doth fall a <hi>Triple Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Leo,</hi> the firſt falling about the middle of <hi>October;</hi> the ſecond about the latter end of <hi>January</hi> 1682/3, and the laſt falls about the beginning of <hi>May</hi> 1683, which Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> will never paſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver without prodigious Effects to all <hi>Europe</hi> in general; for at the firſ time they are conjoyned, <hi>Mars</hi> is found in <hi>Virgo,</hi> and the July before the <hi>Sun</hi> Lord of the Conjunction ſuffered and Eclipſe in <hi>Leo,</hi> his own Houſe not far from the place of the Conjunction of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars September</hi> 6 1682; and the Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> 11th. 1682, and it is not far elongated from the Conjucction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter Octob.</hi> 1682, at which time <hi>Mercury</hi> will be in <hi>Scorpio</hi> in <hi>Quartile</hi> to both <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> all theſe Poſitions are very remarkable, and without all doubt will have great Influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all thoſe places under <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Virgo;</hi> as alſo under <hi>Aquarius, Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Scorpio</hi> and <hi>Taurus;</hi> neither ſhall <hi>Aries</hi> and <hi>Gemini</hi> be free for thoſe Countrys; under <hi>Aries</hi> this Conjunction falls in their 6th, and tells them they will go nigh to be affected with a Plague, the more becauſe <hi>Mars</hi> Lord of their <hi>Aſcendant</hi> is in the 6th alſo at the time of the Conjunction; and the ſecond time they are conjoyned <hi>(viz.) January</hi> 1683 <hi>Mars</hi> will be in <hi>Libra</hi> in <hi>Oppoſition</hi> to their <hi>Aſcendant,</hi> and in <hi>Quartile</hi> to their 10, this doth declare that they ſhall as well be afflicted with a War as a Plague, and doth likewiſe declare, that the Great Ones of thoſe Nations under <hi>Aries</hi> ſhall have a great deal of Trouble and Loſſes; nay, and ſome of thoſe of the greater Rank and Quality ſhall reſign to Death, to the ſorrow of that Nation, but more of that when I come to treat of that Conjunction wholly.</p>

            <p>FOR to erect a Figure for the time of this Conjunction, would be too great a Curioſity for any to attempt, ſeeing their Motions are ſo ſlow, and it is a matter of Queſtion, whether all former Obſervations of the Ancients are to a minute, from whence all Tables are framed, and ſhould they but erre one minute in <hi>Saturn</hi>'s place, it would cauſe near 8 hours diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in time, and from this very reaſon cannot there be any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of ſetting of a Figure for the time of their Conjunction, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will be convenient that a Figure be ſet for the Full Moon following, which fell on the day that Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Heydon</hi> made Obſervation which fell on <hi>December</hi> 7th 1603, at 21 <hi>H.</hi> 26 <hi>M.

            <p>And ſeeing the Nature and Property of this Triplicity (by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral conſent of the Learned) is diametrically contrary to the former, it may be rationally conjectured, that the more eminent Changes and Alterations are likely to happen e'er the effects thereof be at a full Period, undoubtedly there will be a great Suppreſſion (if not a total Subverſion) of ſome Ancient Monarchys, Kingdoms and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, with an Alteration of their Laws, Cuſtoms and Priviledges, and alſo of ſome Ancient Families who had their firſt Foundation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Gemini, Virgo</hi> or <hi>Piſces,</hi> and in their rooms new ones erected, which ſhall continue till ſome contrary Configurations of Heaven do produce their Diſſolution; as for Example, the <hi>Saxons</hi> entred <hi>Britain</hi> 479 Years after Chriſt, or ſoon after, 8 Years before that there was a Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Gemini,</hi> and 9 Years after the Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Sagitarius,</hi> 809 their Heptarchy was reduced to a Monarchy, and 8 or 9 Years after the firſt Conjunction in the Earthy Triplicity in <hi>Virgo,</hi> it being in Square both to <hi>Gemini</hi> and <hi>Sagitarius,</hi> at which time the <hi>Danes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan their Monarchy, and the next time <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> came in Conjunction in <hi>Virgo,</hi> which was 50 Years after; then came the <hi>Narmans;</hi> and upon this Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitarius</hi> 1603; then came <hi>Scotlands</hi> King to be King of all <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and thus you ſee all beginnings as to thoſe Grand Affairs, hath had their end upon Conjunctions in Signs of a contrary nature.</p>
            <p>So many Planets poſited in the Sign of the Conjunction (ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and applying) conſidering alſo that the Conjunctions of <hi>Mars</hi> the Year following, firſt with <hi>Saturn,</hi> and then with <hi>Jupiter,</hi> both near the place of the great Conjunction, and in <hi>Oppoſition</hi> of the <hi>Aſcendant</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> theſe may induce us to conceive that ſome more than ordinary effects are to be ſignified by this return of the Superiours into the Fiery Triplicity,<note place="margin">Vide Edling.</note> I ſay, more than perhaps hath uſually happened from any, or moſt of thoſe that have preceeded ſince the Creation of the World;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42780:15"/>and that amongſt other places, <hi>London,</hi> and generally the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is herein concerned; thus much Mr. <hi>Edling,</hi> and there is hardly any living but what are ſenſible of the truth of theſe Predictions.</p>
            <p>But there is yet many more notable Tranſactions to happen in the World from the effects of this great Conjunction; for bycor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal or double bodied Signs do ſignifie or operate moſt upon Men, and thoſe of the Higheſt Rank <hi>(viz.)</hi> Kings and Magiſtrates, and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of Kingdoms or Commonwealths, therefore the effects will be found to operate both upon Matters and Perſons of both Church and State, and ſeeing that whatſoever had its Riſe from any Eminent Configuration of the Superiour Bodies, muſt alſo expect to receive a great Suppreſſion and Moleſtation from its contrary, and it is the Opinion of <hi>Spineus</hi> in his <hi>Cataſtrophe mundi,</hi> that as <hi>Mahomet</hi> had his Riſe from the Influence of the Watry Trigon, ſo from the effects of this Reſtitution of the Superiours in this Fiery <hi>Trygon,</hi> it being diametrically oppoſite to the Watry, ſhall that Religion receive great batement and moleſtation; and in <hi>page</hi> 25 of that Book, from the Influence of this Conjunction, <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed, then ſhall follow an Univerſal Peace, and a general Empire of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> or the Faith of Chriſt more enlarged throughout the World. Thus much <hi>Spineus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before all theſe things be compleated, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhall be at Wars one with another, and ſhall give encouragement to the Grand <hi>Turk</hi> to invade <hi>Europe,</hi> and he ſhall paſs through all <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and part of <hi>Spain,</hi> almoſt to the ruining of all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> after which he ſhall by the Divine Power of God turn <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> after which he ſhall deſtroy the Dregs of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſhall ſettle a General Peace throughout the known parts of the World.</p>
            <p>Neither is the Judgment of Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> upon this Conjunction to be ſlighted <hi>(viz.)</hi> That God will reſtrain <hi>Monarchical</hi> Pomp, and reduce all to an <hi>Ariſtocratical Mediocrity</hi> both in Church and Sate, but before this be effected <hi>Omnia nutu unius regentur,</hi> as <hi>Cardan</hi> long ſince Predicted, after which God will give ſo long a Peace, and ſuch Tranquility to the Earth, as ſhe never enjoy'd the like. In the mean time (ſaith he) as <hi>Saturn, Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Scheme are in the 12th. I conceive, that privately by Lyes, by Treachery, by ſeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſſembling Treaties and Ambaſſadors, and by the Policy of a <hi>Jeſuitical</hi> Faction all over <hi>Europe,</hi> the True <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion ſhall infinitely be diſtreſſed, and the Heavenly Intentions impedited;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42780:16"/>and all thoſe Countries that profeſs that Opinion, ſhall be exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moleſted by ſo ſecret a Compact of Villains and falſe hearted Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, lurking in the boſome of Princes, as that many will think <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi> and <hi>Papiſm</hi> ſhall return to its old Seat in every Country; but that will never be in our Kingdoms, for <hi>Jùpiter</hi> being in his Chief Houſe cannot but in fine overcome, and the rather, becauſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> in the <hi>Aſcendant,</hi> which ſhew God will miraculouſly by the means of ſome young Prince or Commonalty of People diſcover and bring to light the cloſe Myſteries of thoſe Plots that from the year 1603 until almoſt 50 years be expired ſhall involve all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> in moſt bloudy Broils, nay till the year 1699.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>ANno</hi> 1604, about the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> this Star was obſerved firſt to appear in the Heavens, in or near 17 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of <hi>Sagitarius,</hi> having of near 2 degrees of <hi>North</hi> Latitude, and as to its Magnitude; <hi>Ricciolus</hi> and others ſay, it was bigger then <hi>Jupiter</hi> or <hi>Venus,</hi> according to its apparent Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, and viſible quantity; it is agreed by all <hi>Aſtronomers</hi> in thoſe days, that the Apparent Magnitude was more than any of the Fixed Stars; and by reaſon of its having no ſenſible Paralax (by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all <hi>Aſtronomers</hi>) ſhews it to be ſituated among the Fixed Stars, far above the <hi>Planetary</hi> Orbs, and had no motion at all in lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude and latitude, as the Planets and other wandring Comes uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally have.</p>
            <p>In Form it was exactly round, caſting no Hair or Tail conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to one place, but more like to the Order and Apparent Cuſtom of the other Fixed Stars; it appeared with a moſt clear twinkling and ſhooting of Beams on every ſide, and that with ſuch gliſtering and ſudden brandiſhing, as hath not been uſually ſeen or obſerved to be in the Heavens among the Stars, the Colour was very variable, like to a many Angled Diamond, by which turning the Sun Beams upon the eyes of the Beholders will reflect with a variable brightneſs; ſo from a bright yellow, anon it became croceal, and in a moment like a Purple and reddiſh, and many times it did appear white, and with a moſt pure twinkling light.</p>
            <p>Its continuance was above a Year, even till the Moneth of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> 1605/6, and conſtantly in the ſame part of the Heavens as to its longitude in the Ecliptick, and it had its firſt Appearance near the time of the Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> as may be ſeen by the Figure of the Full Moon preceeding.</p>

            <p>The Places of the Planets <hi>(ex Ephem. Orig.)</hi> at the Lunation precee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the firſt Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this Star. This Star appeared viſible near five Hendred days, therefore it will be five Hundred years before the full effects of this New Star be fulfilled.</p>
            <p>It is here needleſs to trouble my ſelf or Reader, with the various Opinions of the Learned, about the Matter and Generation of Comets or. New Stars; but as to its place, it being ſo near the place of the Great Conjunction, and the place of the Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> the Year follow that alſo, being near the great Conjunction, from whence we may learn that there is extraordinary events that muſt enſue from this laſt return of the Superiours into the Fiery Trigon, from its magnitude, diſtance, ſtability, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, quality and duration of the effects declared, and by its habit to the Sun, and the direction the time thereof in general.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing that this New Star was occidental of the Sun, and ſo appeared not till after Sun-ſet, and by the Doctrine of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> the effects thereof muſt not be expected to be manifeſted ſo-ſuddenly to the World, as if it had Riſe before the Sun; but as the Sun did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach nearer and nearer, and ſo by degrees and for ſome time, did obſcure the Light of the Star; ſo will the effects be obſcured or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded for a time, or till excited by ſubſequent Configurations; yet ſo as it muſt operate with the Conjunction, becauſe it was ſo near the Aſcendant thereof, that is near the place thereof the Conjunction. it ſelf was oriental of the Sun, and ſo might denote ſome ſudden Changes to happen in the World; and after <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> were
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42780:19"/>ſeparated one from the other, and were about making their ſeveral Conjunctions with <hi>Mars,</hi> then did this Star appear occidental, near to the place of the great Conjunction, denoting at length, and even before the effects of this Conjunction are compleated, muſt there be ſome eminent, and more than ordinary Changes to happen to the World; yet very little hitherto hath been taught by the <hi>Ancients,</hi> concerning the effects of theſe, or ſuch like Prodigies of this Nature, ſo that we cannot attain ſo exactly to the particular events; only this we may conclude, that extraordinary Cauſes will have extraordinary Effects, and that from <hi>Aſtrological</hi> Principles, and Grounds of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spineus</hi> ſaith, that about that part of Heaven in which a Mock-Star appeareth, ſhall a Man ariſe which in ſhew ſhall reſemble Gold. And <hi>Cardanus</hi> tell us, <hi>Segm.</hi> 2. <hi>Aph.</hi> 204. Comets appearing in the Eaſt do ſignifie the Birth of a. Great Man who ſhall be a Maker or Giver of Laws: and in <hi>Segm.</hi> 3. <hi>Aph.</hi> 117. immoveable Comets do ſignifie Seditions, and being in the Fiery Trigon it excites to Wars; Commotions and Conflagrations to happen in the World, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe this Mock-Star was of a <hi>Mars</hi>-like colour. Yet ſeeing at length it appeared of a more bright or jovial colour, <hi>Spineus</hi> will have it, that after there hath been ſuch Wars, Sedition, burnings of Towns and Citys, and great ſlaughters of Mankind, then it ſhould ſignifie the Kingdom of Peace. Any one may conclude with him, that there will be great Changes of Laws and Cuſtoms, deſtruction to divers States and Monarchies, beyond what could be ſignified from the Great Conjunction, for elſe why was it viſible ſo near the place and time thereof: That which is worth taking notice of, is that dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the appearance of this New Star, all the Planets came in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with it. Beſides, it was not only elevated above the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets in the Conjunction, both in reſpect of its Latitude from the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliptick and Situation, or diſtance from the Earth, but alſo exceeded all the Planets in Magnitude and Light.</p>
            <p>And conſidering that all the Planets, except the <hi>Moon,</hi> are under the Earth, and <hi>Saturn, Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> and the <hi>New-ſtar</hi> are in the Fourth Houſe, without doubt it will be long before the effects will ſhew themſelves fully to the World, and becauſe the firſt Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance thereof was ſo near the Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> with <hi>Mars,</hi> and all nigh the place of the great Conjunction, and the Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> 1663. Therefore the effects thereof have in abundant meaſure ſhewed themſelves this laſt 20
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42780:19"/>Years, and ſhall ſhew themſelves more and more during the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the Fiery Trigon; and for the better underſtanding when the effects will be moſt manifeſt, I have directed the New Star and all the Planets in the Figure of the Full Moon preceeding the Appearance thereof (which may give ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to any one that pleaſe to conſider them) to the Year 1702; as for Example, In the year 1666 the <hi>Sun</hi> came to the <hi>New-Star,</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> to the <hi>Oppoſition</hi> of the ſaid Star, and then was <hi>London</hi> bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. <hi>London</hi> is under <hi>Gemini,</hi> and the <hi>Oppoſition</hi> fell in <hi>Gemini</hi> alſo</p>

            <p>Oh! how many Changes of Kingdoms. Oh! how much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting and bewailing the condition of diſgrace! Oh! what ſorts and difference of dangers and troubles are to be feared? what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable great and grievous Villanies? Oh! what turbulent and damnable Seditions? Oh! what unlooked and unhoped for miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous kinds of death? Oh! what exalting of wicked and reprobate Men, the troubled Stars of Heaven do belch out? Oh! what wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and indigent Perſons are every where extolled, and the rich op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and impoveriſhed? How many Subjects and Servants ſhall rule whilſt Kings and Maſters ſhall obey. What Princes ſhall be thrown out of their Dominions? Oh! what inſolent, Drunken and Luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men, who ſhall have the Habit of Whoredom? What inventers of new and unheard of Luſts, Buggeries, Gluttons, Murtherers, Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, Deceivers, and Traitors, and Thieves (without cauſe) ſuch as ſhall deride, torment, and tear in pieces, and kill with very vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all Men that be endued with Prudence, Knowledge and Wiſdom, but they ſhall be of a conſtant mind; and although theſe things ſhall be fierce after the year 1630, yea more fierce after 1650; yet ſhall they be moſt terrible and rigorous after the year 1660: God divert the evil that is yet further portended from the effects of this <hi>New Star</hi> from the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> for ſince the Year 1660 there hath been a great deal of this production come to paſs, and a great deal more there is behind, which not only <hi>England,</hi> but <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Germany, Holland, Scotland,</hi> and almoſt all the whole World, in one meaſure or other, within this 20 years will be ſenſible of, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Wars, Plagues, Famine and cruel deſtruction of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, with the burning of Towns and Citys. And ſo much may ſerve or the Judgment of the <hi>New Star,</hi>

Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> obſerves, that <hi>Saturn</hi> cannot (or ſeldom doth paſs through the Fiery Triplicity, but he doth afflict <hi>London</hi> with a Plague, or ſome other Epidemical Diſeaſe, of which I will give a few Examples: <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1348 <hi>Saturn</hi> was in <hi>Aries,</hi> an Univerſal Plague in <hi>London:</hi> 1485 <hi>Saturn</hi> in <hi>Sagitarius</hi> a Sweating Sickneſs in <hi>London:</hi> 1507 <hi>Saturn</hi> in <hi>Leo,</hi> another Sweating Sickneſs in <hi>London:</hi> 1517 <hi>Saturn</hi> in <hi>Sagitarius,</hi> the third Sweating Sickneſs in <hi>London:</hi> 1530 <hi>Saturn</hi> in <hi>Aries,</hi> the fourth Sweating Sickneſs in <hi>London:</hi> 1544 <hi>Saturn</hi> in <hi>Sagitarius,</hi> a great Plague in <hi>London,</hi> which adjourned the Term to St. <hi>Albans:</hi> 1564 <hi>Saturn</hi> in <hi>Leo,</hi> the Plague in <hi>London</hi> after the return of the Army from <hi>New-haven:</hi> 1594 <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> was in <hi>Leo,</hi> a great Plague in <hi>London,</hi> which cauſed the Term to be again holden at St. <hi>Albans:</hi> 1603 <hi>Saturn</hi> was in <hi>Sagitarius</hi> when that great Plague began in <hi>London</hi> which devoured ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands; one thouſand ſix hundred and 25 <hi>Saturn</hi> was in <hi>Leo</hi> when that other great Plague began in <hi>Londonn</hi> which remov'd the Parliament to <hi>Oxford:</hi> 1633 and 1634, and 1635, <hi>Saturn</hi> was in <hi>Sagitarius</hi> when the Plague raged in ſo many parts of <hi>England:</hi> 1665 <hi>Saturn</hi> had but newly entred <hi>Capricorn,</hi> when the great Plague of all was in <hi>London;</hi> and truly I fear another great Plague in <hi>London</hi> before <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> has paſſed quite through <hi>Leo</hi> 1683, the more, becauſe <hi>Mars</hi> makes his Conjunction with <hi>Jupiter</hi> on the 6th. of <hi>September</hi> in 12 degrees of <hi>Leo,</hi> and on the 11th. day of the ſame Moneth, <hi>Mars</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:42780:23"/>meets with a Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> in the 16 degrees of the ſame Sign <hi>Leo,</hi> and on the 17 day of <hi>October Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> make their Conjunction in 19 degrees of the ſame Sign <hi>Leo;</hi> but that is not all, for on or about the 19th. day of <hi>January</hi> following, the ſame Planet <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> make their ſecond Conjunction in 18 degrees of <hi>Leo,</hi> and near the 10 day of <hi>May</hi> 1683, they make their third Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction in 16 degrees of <hi>Leo,</hi> in the very place of the Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> the <hi>September</hi> before; all theſe things make me to conjecture that we ſhall have another great Plague e'er <hi>Saturn</hi> hath paſſed quite through <hi>Leo,</hi> and not only that, but a many more great Calamities to a great many places of <hi>Europe,</hi> but more of that in its proper place.</p>

            <p>THis Conjunction, according to the uſual Order of the Superiors, ſhould have been in <hi>Aries,</hi> and ſo have made their third Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction in the Fiery Triplicity: but contrarily it happened in <hi>Piſces,</hi> which is a Sign of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aſt Triplicity, ſo that after two Conjunctions made in the Fiery Trigon, this prepoſterouſly comes in to finiſh the Period of the laſt Triplicity.</p>
            <p>And indeed the effects was of as contrary a Nature, as any one may ſee that pleaſe to read the Anuals of thoſe times, <hi>(viz.)</hi> from 43 to 1663. for was there not a ſuppreſſing and abrogating of former Laws, Religion, Cuſtoms, Priviledges, and Government; if any one do but conſider the Malevolent Conſiguration of the Planets, at the time of the Conjunction, may from thence Judge from the Rules of <hi>Aſtrologie,</hi> that this Conjunction was the fore-runner of much faction: but ſeeing Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> in his Prophetical Merline, hath handled that Conjunction very well; I ſhall ſay no more of it, but haſt to that which is more uſeful for our purpoſe.</p>

            <p>This way of directing the Aſcendant and Midhaven, will find out both the Time and Quality of the effects, the Conjunction doth ſignifie the place, alſo if the poſition of the Aſpect at the time of the Conjunction be conſidered, as for Example, in the year 1672. the Aſcendant met with the <hi>Quartile</hi> of the place of the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> in the Figure of the <hi>Full-Moon,</hi> 1603. and the <hi>Quartile</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> at the <hi>Full-Moon,</hi> before the appearance of the <hi>Comet,</hi> 1652. now the ſquare of both fell in <hi>Virgo,</hi> now the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces under <hi>Virgo</hi> are <hi>Sileſa,</hi> and ſeveral other places belonging to <hi>Germany,</hi> in this year did <hi>France</hi> enter <hi>Germany,</hi> and has made great devaſtation upon the <hi>Rhyne,</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> is the Guberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of <hi>Holland,</hi> and the Aſcendant meeting with the <hi>Quartile</hi> of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and did not <hi>Holland</hi> that year feel the ſmart of War al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and in the year 1673. the Aſcendant met with the Body of <hi>Mars,</hi> and the <hi>M.

A ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more Examples might be produced, but by reaſon this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction is at an end, and a more remarkable one approaching; I ſhall reſt ſilent as to that, and haſte to that which is more Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial to our purpoſe: onely note thus much, that <hi>Mars</hi> at the time of the ſellebration of this Conjunction, was in or near 9 Degrees of <hi>Leo,</hi> the very Cuſp of the 12th, the <hi>Full-Moon</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, the appearance of the <hi>New Star,</hi> 1604, which <hi>Stars</hi> place, fell near the place of the Conjunction, 1663, and <hi>Mars</hi> alſo was Lord of the 9th in that Figure, and was placed in the 3d. of the <hi>Full-Moon,</hi> preceeding the Conjunction 1663. and in the <hi>New-Moon</hi> following <hi>Mars,</hi> is placed in the Aſcendant; from hence ſhould all the Actions of this laſt paſt 19 years, be wholly of the Nature of <hi>Mars, (viz.)</hi> Wars, Houſe-burning, and Plagues, and ſeeing he is Lord of the 9th. of the Appearance of the <hi>New Star</hi> 1604 and 4th alſo, this doth, ſhew that all his Actions ſhould be under a ſhew of Religion.</p>

            <p>There hath alſo been another Comet ſeen on the 23d and 24th of <hi>April</hi> 1677, but by reaſon of its ſhort a continuance; there could not be any conſiderable obſervations made thereof, but only I obſerve, it was not far from the place of <hi>Saturn</hi> and near to <hi>Meduſes</hi> head, there was likewiſe a third Comet ſeen in the Year 1665. but I could never get an <hi>Ephemeris</hi> thereof, the firſt Comet that was ſeen in the Year 1664 was by all that obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it to be a <hi>Saturnal</hi> Comet, <hi>(viz.)</hi> of a <hi>Saturnal</hi> colour, and the Comet 1665. was of the nature of <hi>Mars,</hi> and the Comet 1671/1, was of the nature of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> and the Comet 1680, was of the nature of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and ſo is this laſt Comet that appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red 1682. I would have the young Artiſt take notice that this laſt Comet had its beginning about the middle of <hi>Cancer,</hi> but was not begun to be obſerved till it was entred into <hi>Leo,</hi> and it has been obſerved to enter <hi>Scorpio</hi> before its diſappearance.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of the Probable effects that attend theſe <hi>Comets</hi> in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>COmets</hi> hath always been known to be the Antecedents of Tragical Events, and <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> have endeavoured to give us Rules to Judge the Quality thereof. Firſt, By its motion in the Sign of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> whether it be. Direct or Retrograde. Secondly, By its Magnitude and Colour, and Thirdld by the part of Heaven, unto which their Stream doth point; I ſhall ſay but little of the <hi>Comets</hi> 1664, and 1665. Nor of the <hi>Comet</hi> 1671/2. Moſt if not all the evil that was preſignified by them, being all by-paſt, for had we not a devouring Plague, 1665. As alſo a War with <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French:</hi> and in the year 1666. was not <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> almoſt deſtroyed by Fire, had we not alſo an Invaſion by the <hi>Dutch</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and ſuſtained great loſs by them, beſides the great Calamity a great many more parts of <hi>Europe</hi> had about thoſe times; and after the appearance of the <hi>Comet,</hi> 1671/2 had we not a great Scarcity in the <hi>North</hi> Parts of <hi>England,</hi> as alſo a War with the <hi>Hollander?</hi> Did not the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Invade <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to the loſs of a great many Men and Towns? And has not that War been prejudicial to <hi>Germany</hi> ever ſince? who is he that is not ſenſible of the many brave Towns that has been deſtroyed by that War, to the undoing of a many thouſand Families?</p>
            <p>And what Man is he that dare preſume to ſay that <hi>Comets</hi> are not the Premoniſher to Men-kind, of ſome more than ordinary Judgment to fall upon them for their ſins? But ſuch hath been the ſecury of our Ages, that unleſs the Judgment falls upon them, ſo ſoon as theſe Signs of Heaven appear, they cannot be made to beleive that thoſe Signs ſignifie any thing at all: but let thoſe reſt themſelves (as they beleive) ſecure, but let them remember that ſecurity dwell next door to deſtruction. For ſhould any one have ſaid to any of thoſe People, dwelling upon the <hi>Ryne,</hi> in <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatio,</hi> in the year 1670. that they ſhould have ſo many of their
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42780:29"/>Towns deſtroyed by a Forreign Invador, they would hardly a believed you, but did reſt themſelves as ſecure as we or any one could do, but this by the by, the Comets of whoſe effects we have had little or no many feſtation as yet, is the Comet that appeared 1680 and the Comet that appeared the while we were a Writing hereof: Now the Comet that appeared 1680 did firſt appear in the Morning on the 7th day of <hi>November</hi> in or near 6 deg of <hi>Libra,</hi> but was not ſeen to any purpoſe till it appeared in <hi>Caprieorn,</hi> and did continually appear until it had moved into <hi>Taurus,</hi> and near the 20 degrees thereof it diſappeared. Now Authors tell us that the Motion of a Comet out of one Sign into another doth manifeſt alſo an Hoſtile Motion of an Enemy from one Region or Country into another. Now by theſe Comets <hi>(viz.)</hi> 1680, and 1682, manifeſts the beginning of more Wars, and the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful effects ſubſequent unto thoſe Wars. <hi>(viz.)</hi> the flight of many from their proper habitations, baniſhment of others, death of great Men of the World, poverty and want to others, ſuddain terrour or aſtoniſhment to all ſorrs of people, unuſhal. Tempeſts, obſcure Weather, many Shipwracks, great ſtore of Snow in its Seaſon, great Floods and mighty Inundations, and foraſmuch as both the heads of theſe Comers was of a <hi>Saturn</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, from whence may be expected Plagnes and Famine to a great many places; great Froſt and Snow.</p>
            <p>Now as to principal places that is like to be ſufferers in theſe calamities, are thoſe places that both theſe Comets paſſed through, and thoſe places that are under thoſe Signs that Riſe all the time that both theſe Comets was viſible, now the Comet in 1680 paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through <hi>Libra, Scorpio, Sagitary, Capricorn, Aquaries,</hi> and <hi>Piſces, Aries, Taurus,</hi> now while the Comet paſſed through <hi>Scorpio</hi> and <hi>Sagitary,</hi> it was ſo near the <hi>Sun</hi> that it could not be ſeen there, for thoſe places are the leaſt concerned in the effects of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.</p>
            <p>And during the time of this Comets appearing every Evening, <hi>Cancer</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> did Aſcend, therefore thoſe places under thoſe Signs muſt expect to have a great ſhare, if not the greateſt of the Calamity that this Comet doth ſignifie.</p>
            <pb n="46" facs="tcp:42780:30"/>
            <p>Under <hi>Libra</hi> are <hi>Auſtria, Alſatia, Livonia, Sabandia, Delphinat, Daſtrina, Caſpia, Thebaida, Sundgova,</hi> Cities, <hi>Lysbon, Friburgh, Spiers, Frankford,</hi> upon <hi>Menc, Halum, Suenorum, Heilbran, Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, Vienna</hi> in <hi>Auſtria, Antwerp.</hi> Under <hi>Scorpio, Norway, Bavaria, Matagony, Catalonia,</hi> Cities, <hi>Algiers, Valentia</hi> in Spain, <hi>Meſſana, Vienna,</hi> in Holland; <hi>Gaunt,</hi> in Flanders, <hi>Frankford</hi> upon Odor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sagitary, Spain, Dalmatia, Sclavonia, Hungaria, Moravia, Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> Cities; <hi>Toledo, Studgard, Rotenburg, Buda, Gaſcovis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Capricorn, Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Maſcovia, Litua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, Saxony, Huſſia,</hi> Cities; <hi>Oxford, Mechlin, Berga, Brandenburg, Vilna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aquares, Muſcovia, Sweadland, Weſtphalia, Moſel, Piemont, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia,</hi> part Cities, <hi>Hamburgh, Bremc, Trent, Salizburgh, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>golſtaec.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Piſces, Portugal, Galitia, Normandy,</hi> Cities, <hi>Alexandria, Hiſpolis, Rhemes, Vorines, Rutiſponc.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under <hi>Aries</hi> are, <hi>England, France, Germany, Seleſia,</hi> the Higheſt <hi>Polonia,</hi> part <hi>Burgundy, Denmark,</hi> Cities, <hi>Naples, Capua, Ferrara, Utrecht, Crackow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Taurus, Ruſſia, Sweadland,</hi> North part; <hi>Lorraign, Franconia, Ireland,</hi> Cities; <hi>Banonia, Mantua, Nants, Leipſig.</hi> Some of which Countries, the War is already apparent, what is remaining, the next 20 years will make manifeſt.</p>
            <p>Neither can it be expected that any of the places ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo all the Calamities that this Comet is the premoniſher of: ſome places ſhall ſuffer by War, others by Plagues; others by Famine; for the Comet will opperate variouſly upon various places.</p>
            <p>When this Comet firſt appeared, it appeared in the very pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Mars,</hi> in the great Conjunction, 1603. and <hi>Mars</hi> at the time of the Comets appearance: was in <hi>Virgo,</hi> in <hi>Quartile</hi> to the <hi>Sun,</hi> in that Conjunction, hence may War be expected: <hi>Mars</hi> is Lord of the grand Seigniors Nativity, and he afflicts <hi>Sagitary,</hi> and <hi>Gemini,</hi> and <hi>Piſces;</hi> therefore thoſe places will be the firſt that ſuffers by War, and that by the great <hi>Turk;</hi> the laſt Comet that appeared, had its beginning about the middle of <hi>Cancer,</hi> and paſſed
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42780:30"/>through <hi>Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra,</hi> and ended in <hi>Scorpio,</hi> and during of this Comets appearing in the Evening, <hi>Aries</hi> did aſcend, therefore thoſe places under that Sign, ſhall be the greateſt ſharers in the Calamities that this Comet doth foreſhew, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Wars, Plagues, and ſcarcity of Grain, and the like, when this Comet firſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it did appear near the place <hi>Saturn,</hi> of the firſt appearance of the Comet 1680. therefore ſhall this Comet have ſaturnal ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects unto thoſe places under <hi>Cancer</hi> and <hi>Aries,</hi> thoſe places under <hi>Cancer</hi> ſhall be ſubject to great Inundations, and thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Aries,</hi> Plagues and Wars, the Comets having ſo ſwift a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through thoſe Signs it appeared in, doth denote the ſiddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the action that ſhall follow, and for as much that it did not ſet at its firſt appearance, therefore are theſe <hi>Northern</hi> parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> moſt concerned in the effects thereof, among which places, let <hi>Scotland</hi> beware, I alſo fear <hi>London</hi> will be ſenſible of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of this Comet, and before the year 1683. be quite over, I fear a great Plague, from which good Lord deliver us; for all thoſe places are concerned in the effects of this Comet where it was viſible, if we will pertake of the Sins, we muſt pertake of the Puniſhment; I pray God keep the people of <hi>England</hi> in peace.</p>
            <p>The New Moon following the appearance of this Comet, we ſhall find <hi>Capricorn</hi> aſcending, and <hi>Saturn, Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> in the 7th Houſe, and the Comet, and the Sun and Moon, in the 8th, the Comets being in the 8th, ſhould ſhew a Mortality to thoſe people under <hi>Capricorn</hi> and <hi>Cancer:</hi> but the principal ſignification of this Comet declares War, the deſtruction of Cities, the ruin and downfal of Kingdoms, the ſlaughters of Mankind, and a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other tragical evils, experience confirmed by many Ages, and from thence obſerved, doth inform us, that the Comets ſeen in the Air have evident effects, but for the better informing of thoſe that are curious inquirers into the nature of Comets, I have Incerted a Catalogue of all the Comets that has appeared ſince the coming of Chriſt.</p>

            <p>Any one that has a mind to be verſed in the Quality of the events of Comets, muſt look back into Hiſtory, and he ſhall inform his Judgment very much; yet for the inſtruction of the young Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, I ſhall recite a few Examples which I hope will not be taken amiſs.</p>
            <p>1402 The Comet that appeared then was the fore-runner of <hi>Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain</hi>'s entrance into <hi>Aſia,</hi> calling himſelf the Wrath of God, and the deſtruction of the Earth, kills 200000 <hi>Turks,</hi> takes <hi>Bajazet</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, binds him with Fetters of Gold, and put him in an Iron Cage, and carrys him Captive through all <hi>Aſia,</hi> making him a Foot-ſtool when he aſcended his Horſe.</p>
            <p>That which follow'd the Comet 1520 that paſſed through <hi>Cancer, Leo</hi> and <hi>Virgo,</hi> was no leſs than 404 Pariſhes drowned by an Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, with all their People and Cattel. The <hi>Turks</hi> take <hi>Buday</hi> in <hi>Hungary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which followed the Comet 1558, was the death of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Charles</hi> V. and 3 Kings, 2 Queens, 2 Dukes, 15 Cardinals; beſides a many more pety Princes and one Pope.</p>
            <p>That which followed the Comet 1559, was a great Famine in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria, Swavia, Bohemia, Bavaria, Ruſſia, Lituania;</hi> alſo a very great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> no leſs than 400000 People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Cattel.</p>
            <p>And that which followed the Comet 1618, the long War in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> by the <hi>Bohemians;</hi> the death of the Emperour and Queen <hi>Ann,</hi> with a many more eminent Mutations in all parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and ſo much ſhall ſerve at this time for the Judgment of theſe Comets.</p>

            <p>THis Conjunction which we are now to handle, happeneth to be the fourth Conjunction ſince their laſt entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Triplicity; the firſt being in the Year 1603, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready handled in the Diſcourſe going before. And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as this Conjunction falls in the Regal Sign <hi>Leo,</hi> of the fiery Triplicity, and being the fourth Conjunction they have made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which Conjunction 1603 being the ſeventh return into this Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, ſince the Creation of the World, and that this Conjunction in <hi>Leo</hi> being thrice repeated, will therefore produce eminent effects; and ſeeing it being a thing impoſſible to get the true time of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions themſelves, we muſt content our ſelves with the times of the New and Full Moons before and after the Conjunction; the firſt Conjunction happeneth about the 17th. day of <hi>October</hi> 1682; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Conjunction happeneth on or about the 20th. of <hi>January</hi> 1682/3, and the 3d. and laſt falleth about the 10th. of <hi>May</hi> 1683, according to the <hi>Caroline</hi> Tables of <hi>Thomas Street,</hi> the full Moon before the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of this Conjunction falls on the 6th. day of <hi>October</hi> at 1 <hi>h.</hi> 33 <hi>m.

            <p>Now Authors tell us that if <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> be conjoyned in <hi>Leo,</hi> there ſhould be ſome ſturdy Prince that ſhould trouble all his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, and that all Princes ſhould grow ravenous, and exerciſe Tyranny over their Subjects, and ſhall endeavour to make himſelf great by undirect means, but in the height of all his greatneſs vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by ſudden death, or is much moleſted by his Vaſſals, leaving his Poſterity in a very unſettled condition; for although this Trigon breeds valiant Men, yet they are extreamly unfortunate, and thoſe evils that have a beginning under the Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Leo</hi> are fixed for a long time; for every Prince doth vainly conceit himſelf to be the only <hi>Alexander,</hi> but their Pride and Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory ſhall bring themſelves and Poſterity to a State much worſe than their beginning.</p>
            <p>This laſt <hi>Conjunction</hi> we had in <hi>Leo,</hi> was that which happened in the Year 1623, and that was followed with the Death of King <hi>James</hi> 1625, and a great Plague, and we have cauſe to fear the approach of another great Plague in the Year 1683, from which <hi>good Lord deliver us;</hi> for if we do but conſider the poſition of Heaven the Full Moon preceeding this <hi>Conjunction,</hi> you will find that <hi>Mars</hi> Lord of the 10th. in the 8th. Houſe, in <hi>Quartile</hi> to <hi>Mercury</hi> in the great <hi>Conjunction,</hi> and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42780:33"/>the Sun Lord of the 8th. is in <hi>Quartile</hi> to the Sign <hi>Aſcending,</hi> and the <hi>Conjunction</hi> it ſelf is not far from the 8th. Houſe: theſe things make me to judge that we have a Plague very near us, and a very great one, and that before 1683 be over; but I dare not be too poſitive in ſuch determinations, but when I conſider the <hi>Conjunction</hi> it ſelf, I find it to fall in the ſixth of thoſe places that have <hi>Aries</hi> for their <hi>Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,</hi> and in the 4th. of thoſe that have <hi>Gemini,</hi> therefore let thoſe beware, for they are threatned with no leſs than a Mortality, and that a great one, which God in his Mercy divert.</p>
            <p>For a preparative to this great <hi>Conjunction,</hi> we have the Sun Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſed upon the 24th. day of <hi>July,</hi> at which time <hi>Mars</hi> Lord of the 7th. was in the 10th. in <hi>Quartile</hi> to the Sign <hi>Aſcending,</hi> the Eclips falls not far in longated form, the place of this <hi>Conjunction (viz.)</hi> in or about 11 degrees of <hi>Leo, Junctinus</hi> tells us, that when the Sun is eclipſed in the Fiery Triplicity, denotes the Baniſhment of ſome Great Perſon, with diſcord and hatred between the People and ſome great Ruler or Governour; many repinings, grudgings and diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Motions of Armies, much War and ſlaughter of Mankind, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Houſes, depopulations of many Countries and Citys, very Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilent Diſeaſes, the Eclips it ſelf f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll in the 10th. therefore it will chiefly concern thoſe that are Rulers and Covernours of Towns and Citys.</p>
            <p>The next thing that helps to uſher in this Conjunction is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of <hi>Tory Mars</hi> with <hi>Jupiter,</hi> as if he did intend to poyſen Juſtice with a haſty, cholerick humour, and cauſe thoſe whoſe places is to act prudently, to act like Mad-men, as if they did endeavour to ſet all in an uproar; <hi>Mars</hi> naturally, as he is poſited in <hi>Leo,</hi> doth repreſent Men of a daring Spirit, hectoring and bouncing, governed too much by their own will, and delighting much in quarrelling, and can hear of nothing that will pleaſe them ſo much as Wars and Battels, and his being in Conjunction with <hi>Jupiter</hi> makes him have a great ſhew of Religion with all his actions. Let thoſe places under <hi>Leo</hi> look to it, for they are principally concerned; yet thoſe places under <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> and <hi>Scorpio,</hi> and <hi>Taurus,</hi> will have a great ſhare in theſe kind of actions; I pray God bleſs the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> from unruly acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for they are under <hi>Taurus,</hi> and this Conjunction, and all the Conjunctions in <hi>Leo</hi> are in <hi>Quartile</hi> to that Sign.</p>
            <p>Upon the 11th day of <hi>September</hi> 1682, there was a Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> in or about the 16 degrees of <hi>Leo:</hi> this Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42780:34"/>on of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> falls near the place of the laſt of the three Conjunctions of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter May</hi> the 10th. 1683, from whence may be expected great Alterations as to Mundane Affairs; <hi>Mars</hi> I find in the Conjunction to be elevated above <hi>Saturn,</hi> having more North latitude than <hi>Saturn,</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi> being very weak, therefore hath <hi>Mars</hi> more power than <hi>Saturn;</hi> therefore what is chiefly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> will be wholly Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; Now if the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family had their Riſe under the Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Scorpio,</hi> as is verily believ'd it did, then that People ſhall afflict a great part of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> for he has lately, or will very ſhortly, change his Aphelion into <hi>Virgo,</hi> which doth ſhew, that thoſe People ſhall move out of their own Country, in way of Conqueſt, and ſhall continue ſo doing for ſome years to come, even till they have made themſelves Maſters of great part of <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It we conſider the quality of <hi>Saturn</hi> in this Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> we ſhall find <hi>Saturn</hi> to be very weak, for <hi>Leo</hi> is <hi>Saturn</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment, and is juſt like a man that is an Enemy to his own Houſe and Family, and one that ſhould ſeek to deſtroy his Poſterity. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> generally is the cauſe of Matters Political and Civil, all ſubtle and Politick Councils, deceitful, private and cunning Stratagems, covetouſneſs, ſelf-ends, deſtruction to ſome Ancient Family and Building, as to Laws, Liberties, Cuſtoms and Priviledges, depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. And this he doth ſignifie in Political Matters.</p>
            <p>In Eccleſiaſtical Affairs he portends great Superſtition, Idolatry, Hypocriſie, Monkery, Jeſuitiſm, and all the ſeveral Orders of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and he doth ſignifie all manner of Debauchery and Baſeneſs under Religious Pretences; all manner of Sects, Schiſms, Hereſies, Jewiſh Superſtitions and Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>Unto Mankind in general he threatens great and difficult labour, poverty and want to many; he afflicts the Body with tedious Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and Diſeaſes, as the Conſumption in the Reins and inward parts; ill and noyſome Vapours, from whence proceed a Plague, Hectick Fevers, deſtruction of Rheum, Quartan Agues, and ſuch like Diſeaſes, as are not eaſily remedied by the moſt Skilful Phyſician; he afflicts the Mind with ſorrow, and fear of lamentable trouble, as alſo Baniſhment and long impriſonments.</p>
            <p>And as to natural things, he portends great want and ſcarcity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Cattel, Corn and Fruits; Famine and Mortality; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42780:34"/>Airs, cold, cloudy, miſty, ſoggy Weather, and long and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Froſts.</p>
            <p>As to the Sea, he ſignifies Shipwrack, and great damage by ruine and decay of Sea banks, from whence comes great Inundation of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, great ſcarcity of Fiſh and Fowl that belong to the Waters.</p>
            <p>Of Perſons, he ſignifies thoſe of ſuperiour Rank and Quality, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the higheſt of all the Planets, and moves the ſloweſt, and he doth ſeldom apply to any Planet, therefore he ſignifies great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſtable Monarchs; but in the general he ſignifies the laborious Country men, Husbandmen, Farmers, Yeomen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in this <hi>Conjunction</hi> he ſignifies a deceitful, ſordid, pernicious ſort of People who will inhabit in the Court of Princes and Kings, who will undermine and ſubvert the more wholeſome purpoſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; but I ſay all theſe ſort of People ſhall ſuffer great loſs of their Eſtates, and ſhall obtain in the room thereof unexpected Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Impriſonments, Baniſhments and the like.</p>
            <p>The laſt time we had <hi>Mars</hi> in Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> in <hi>Leo</hi> was the 10th. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1650, the <hi>December</hi> following we had a Comet appeared, and I have good reaſon to predict the appearance of more Comets before 1683 be over, let any one but look into the Annals for 1653 and 1654, and they will find what followed that Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 1652, but ſeeing that the effects of this Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> can't laſt but for two years, and <hi>Mars</hi> being ſwift in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the time of the Conjunction, even ſo ſhall all that is porten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by this Conjunction be as ſwift in motion <hi>(viz.)</hi> Armies ſhall run like Lightning over a great many Countrys of <hi>Europe,</hi> and ſhall bring more under ſubjection in 2 years, than any Armies have done for this ten years laſt paſt, and foraſmuch as Chriſtianity was firſt preacht by Chriſt our Saviour under the Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Leo,</hi> and now <hi>Mars</hi> being in Conjunction in this Sign with <hi>Saturn,</hi> and having of the greater power, will afflict Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the Sword more than ordinary. At the time of this famous Conjunction we find <hi>Mars</hi> newly entered into <hi>Virgo,</hi> in <hi>Quartile</hi> to the great Conjunction 1603, and moveth but ſlowly from whence the evils ſignified by <hi>Mars</hi> to be of long continuance, <hi>(viz.)</hi> War and Bloudſhed, <hi>Virgo</hi> is held to be ſign of the Conjunction before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of the <hi>Normans,</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> hath not been in <hi>Virgo</hi> in neither of the Conjunctions ſince 1603, therefore may more than ordinary events follow; the more becauſe <hi>Mars</hi> before the ſecond Conjunction
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42780:35"/>of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter, January</hi> 1682/3, will paſs the <hi>Quartile</hi> of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> 1603, and alſo the <hi>Quartile</hi> of <hi>Saturn, Jupiter</hi> and the New Star 1604, and the <hi>Quartile</hi> of <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> and the <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi> of the <hi>Moon</hi> 1603, and comes to the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of his own place 1603, and all before <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> meets the ſecond time; let but any one conſider the poſition of <hi>Mars</hi> the firſt time the two Superiours meet, and they will find cauſe enough to dread the evils of <hi>Mars.</hi>

            <p>Now <hi>Mars</hi> being placed in the 9th. from the <hi>Conjunction</hi> 1603, and meeting with the <hi>Quartile</hi> of <hi>Mercury</hi> Lord thereof firſt; all thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are under the gubernation of <hi>Mercury,</hi> will feel the ſmart of the influence of <hi>Mars;</hi> now becauſe <hi>Mercury</hi> is poſited in <hi>Sagitarius</hi> in the great <hi>Conjunction,</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> caſting his <hi>Square</hi> there, out of the 9th. of that <hi>Conjunction,</hi> thoſe places ſhall feel the heavy effect of <hi>Mars (viz.)</hi> Wars: now the places under <hi>Sagitarius,</hi> are <hi>Spain, Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia, Sclavonia, Hungary, Moravia,</hi> with abundance of more Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys and Cities that are under the poſition of <hi>Sagitarius</hi> for their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant; theſe places muſt expect to have great Calamity; ſome of them ſhall ſuffer by Invaſion; others by Plague; others by Famine, and a great deſtruction of Mankind in general: <hi>Mereury</hi> generally ſignifies all manner of Arts and Sciences, as alſo Merchants; theſe ſorts of Men muſt expect to be great ſufferers by the power of <hi>Mars, (viz.)</hi> great Storms, from whence comes great Shipwracks. <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Gemini</hi> govern <hi>Flanders,</hi> part of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Lumbardy, Brabant,</hi> the Dukedom of <hi>Wertenburgh, London, Corduha</hi> in <hi>Spain, Bruges</hi> in <hi>Flanders, Mentz,</hi> and a many more places, that are not yet attributed to <hi>Gemini;</hi> in theſe places may expect to have Commotions; for <hi>Mars</hi> is the ſtirrer up of Wars, damnable Seditions, Tumults, Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, the frowns and indignation of Princes towards their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects cauſed by <hi>Mars,</hi> he being Lord of the 11th. and 12th. of the great <hi>Conjunction</hi> 1603, and is placed near the Cuſp of the 10th. of that <hi>Conjunction,</hi> he doth by the Poſitions repreſent Noblemen that ſhould be in great favour of Princes, but are great enemies of the People in general; if we place <hi>Gemini</hi> upon the Cuſp of the <hi>Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,</hi> we ſhall find the <hi>Tory Mars</hi> to be placed in fifth in <hi>Quartile</hi> to the Sign Aſcending, he being Lord of the 12th. and in his laſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with <hi>Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Leo,</hi> he oppoſed the 10th. what can we expect from hence, but that <hi>Mars</hi> ſhould act like a <hi>Tory</hi> as he is among the Stars, ſetting all together by the Ears, and that now publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42780:35"/>in thoſe places under <hi>Gemini,</hi> and he will be as well rewarded for his pains; for <hi>Mars</hi> is placed in the Eighth the Houſe of Death, of the Full Moon preceding the Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> 1682; if we place <hi>Aries</hi> upon the Aſcendant, we ſhall find both the Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> fall all of them in the 6th. in <hi>Quartile</hi> to the intercepted Sign <hi>Taurus</hi> in the <hi>Aſcendant,</hi> and the <hi>Sun</hi> Lord of the 6th. having lately ſuffered an Eclipſe in the 6th. all theſe will cauſe both the great and ſmall Cattle to ſuffer by Diſeaſes, to the detriment of the Country Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer that lives in thoſe Countrys ſubject to the Sign <hi>Aries,</hi> the more becauſe <hi>Mars</hi> is in <hi>Quartile</hi> to the ſecond, if we conſider the place where <hi>Mars</hi> caſteth his <hi>Oppoſition,</hi> we ſhall find it to be in <hi>Piſces,</hi> and <hi>Piſces</hi> is aſſigned by <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> to govern <hi>Portugal, Galitia, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> with the Citys of <hi>Rhems, Worms</hi> and <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more places, this hateful <hi>Oppoſition</hi> of <hi>Mars</hi> will cauſe in thoſe places great corruptions of their Fruits by impetuous blaſts, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe will deſtroy their Grain, cauſing a great ſcarcity thereby: He will cauſe great heat and drought, and will exclte mens minds to great raſhneſs, and to all manner of evil, and likewiſe cauſe great diſſention among Kindred; as for <hi>Virgo,</hi> the place where <hi>Mars</hi> is at the time of the firſt Conjunction, are attribute to govern <hi>Achaia, Greece, Athens, Meſopotamia, Babylon, Aſſyria,</hi> part of the <hi>Rhyne, Sile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> the lower; of Citys <hi>Jeruſalem, Rhodes, Navar</hi> in <hi>Italy, Paris, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Baſil, Heydleberg, Erphord,</hi> theſe are the chief places under the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of unfortunate <hi>Mercury,</hi> and therefore muſt expect to meet with ſuch like misfortunes as are of the nature of <hi>Mars,</hi> among which <hi>Paris</hi> is like to ſuffer by notorious Frauds, Cheats, Mutinies, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, and moſt horrid Villanies, and ſecret Conſpiracies; nay more than that I fear another Maſſacre, or ſome ſuch unruly actions; and thus much for the general judgment of <hi>Mars,</hi> during the time that he is in <hi>Virgo;</hi> but if we conſider the ſecond Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter;</hi> we ſhall find <hi>Mars</hi> then placed in <hi>Libra,</hi> and he doth continue 226 days in that Sign, and doth ſtay but 53 days in <hi>Virgo,</hi> therefore thoſe places that are under <hi>Libra, Aries, Cancer,</hi> and <hi>Capricorn</hi> ſhall have a longer time of ſuffering than thoſe places that are under <hi>Virgo, Piſces, Gemini</hi> and <hi>Sagitarius,</hi> becauſe <hi>Mars</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſuch a ſwift paſſage through <hi>Virgo.</hi> Thoſe places under <hi>Libra</hi> are <hi>Auſtria, Alſatia, Livonia,</hi> Citys <hi>Lisbon, Fribourg, Spiers, Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> at <hi>Mane, Vienna</hi> in <hi>Auſtria, Antwerp,</hi> and a many more places, not as yet allotted to this Sign; in theſe places will <hi>Mars</hi> powre down his Influence, which will be of the nature as before recited. Now dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42780:36"/>the time that he paſſeth through <hi>Libra,</hi> he will caſt his hateful <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi> to <hi>Aries,</hi> as if he did intend nothing but fire and ſword to thoſe places under <hi>Aries,</hi> but he will not be able to do the miſchief he intends, becauſe he is in his detriment, and the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> doth behold the Sign <hi>Aries</hi> with a <hi>Trine,</hi> yet nevertheleſs they muſt have their ſhare of the effect of <hi>Mars,</hi> being in <hi>Oppoſition</hi> to their Sign.

            </q>
            <p>And this ſhall ſuffice for the Judgment of <hi>Mars</hi> in all the three Conjunctions. Now let us conſider the <hi>Conjunction</hi> it ſelf. We find it falls in <hi>Leo,</hi> not far enlongated from that famous fixed Star, called the <hi>Lyons. Heart,</hi> which Star is of the nature of <hi>Mars:</hi> We are adviſed by thoſe that have been learned in this Study, to take the Fortitudes and Debill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>udes of all the Planets; both the Full Moon going before this Conjunction, and the New Moon following; by which means we ſhall find which is the ſtrongeſt of them all, and he we muſt account to have the greateſt ſhare of the effects. Now having conſidered, I find <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> to be equally fortified, and they two to be the ſtrongeſt of all the reſt, both of them at the Full Moon having of 27 Teſtimonies of ſtrength, all the reſt having of but few, <hi>Saturn</hi> we find to have no Eſſential Dignities, and <hi>Jupiter</hi> to have but Triplicity.</p>
            <p>The Declination of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> is above 18 degrees <hi>North,</hi> at the time of the Conjunction, by which means they have a great Diurnal Arch, and by that means continue above 15 hours above the <hi>Horizon,</hi> between Riſing and Setting; therefore will theſe <hi>Northern</hi> parts be ſubject the more to their effects; for by how much a Star doth make the longer ſtay above the <hi>Horizon,</hi> by ſo much more is he fitted by thoſe his direct beams, to make a ſtronger impreſſion of his vertue over or upon thoſe parts, and ſeeing that not only the places particularly ſubject to the Dominion of the Sign wherein the Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction happens, but alſo the Triplicity and Quadrangle thereto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to <hi>Ptolomy.</hi> Now the Triplicity <hi>Aries, Leo, Sagitarius,</hi> are ſaid by moſt Authors to operate moſt upon the Chriſtians, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of <hi>Cardane</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which if true, then by the declination of the Planets, the Northern and North-Eaſt parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> will be the moſt principal places deſigned for the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the effects of this Conjunction.</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:42780:36"/>
            <p>Now under the ſign of this Conjunction, <hi>viz. Leo</hi> are <hi>Gallia To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gata,</hi> the <hi>Alpes, Italy, Sicily, Apulia, Bohemia, Turkey</hi> part: Cities <hi>Rome, Damaſco, Ravenna, Cremona, Prague.</hi> Now all of theſe places ſhall feel in one kind or other, the ſmart of this Conjunction.</p>
            <p>Thoſe eminent Perſons who have the Sign <hi>Leo,</hi> aſcending at their Nativity, and near the Degrees of the Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> will be the Perſons moſt active in carrying on the affairs of thoſe places wherein they live, but by reaſon there is a Conjunction of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> near the ſame Degrees, and near the ſame time <hi>(viz.)</hi> a Month before this, I ſay, will fling thoſe Perſons into many Perils and Dangers, both to their Body by health, and Eſtate; and thoſe Perſons that have this Conjunction in Quartile, or Oppoſition, to their Degree, aſcending at Birth, will be much afflicted with Sickneſs and Croſſes; and thoſe that have the Conjunction in Quartile, or Oppoſition of their Degree of their tenth ☉ or <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, or ☿ will find great Croſſes as to Honour and Reputation; but on the contrary, all thoſe Perſons that have the <hi>Conjunction</hi> in Trine, or Sextile, to their Degree aſcending, or to the Degree of their tenth ☉ or <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, or part of Fortune, ſhall all of them injoy health, and gain great Reputation and Wealth; during the time of the <hi>Conjunction,</hi> the Operation, which is worth our obſervation, is the New Moon before the ſecond <hi>Conjunction, (viz.)</hi> the 17th day of <hi>January,</hi> the Sun ſuffers an Eclipſe near the cuſp of the 9th, with the Dragons-tail, and <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> are in Oppoſition to both the Sun and Moon: Now <hi>Saturn</hi> is Lord of the 7th, 8th, and 9th, and the Moon being Lady of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant, and the Sun Lord of the ſecond: Now the Aſcendant doth repreſent the common ſort of People, and the ſecond the moveable wealth; therefore muſt the common People ſuffer both in Body and Eſtate. Authors tell us that when the Sun ſuffers an Eclipſe in the firſt decade of <hi>Aquarius,</hi> it is the Fore-runner of publick ſorrow and mourning to thoſe of the higheſt Rank and Quality, but not ſo to the poor Husbandman, and by reaſon it falls ſo near the 9th, it ſhews detriment to Religion, and all things relating to the 9th, and the Full Moon following of this Conjunction, the Moon ſuffers an Eclipſe in the 23d Degree of <hi>Leo,</hi> near both the <hi>Conjunction,</hi> and that famous fixt Star <hi>Cor Leonis;</hi> and the ſame Author tell us that if that <hi>Luna</hi> ſuffer an Eclipſe in the third decade of <hi>Leo,</hi> it declares the diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſs of the people in general, and that they ſhould be deſirous of new Laws and Governours.</p>
            <p>If the Aſcendant of an Eclipſe doth repreſent the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then is <hi>Cancer</hi> the Sign, and the Moon their ſignification, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42780:37"/>
               <hi>Saturn</hi> being Lord of the 8th. is in Oppoſition to the Moon, from hence may be conjectured the Death of the vulgar ſort of People, by a Plague or ſome ſuch kind of Diſeaſes; and in the Full Moon follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Conjunction,</hi> the Sun is Lord of the Aſcendant, and is placed in the 8th. in a dejected condition, and <hi>Saturn</hi> is Lord of the 8th. Houſe, and in the Aſcendant; from this Eclipſe alſo may be predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the Death of the common ſort of people by Sickneſs; neither will the Governours of Towns and Cities eſcape Death; for <hi>Mars</hi> Lord of the 10th. of the <hi>Lunar</hi> Eclipſes following the <hi>Conjunction, January</hi> 1682/3, is placed in the 4th. in Oppoſition to the 10th. in a very weak condition, from whence their Death ſhall come through their own means.</p>
            <p>If we conſider the Sun Lord of the <hi>Conjunction,</hi> at the time of the <hi>Conjunction, October</hi> 1682. which according to Mr. <hi>Street,</hi> falls on the 17th. day, we ſhall find him placed in <hi>Scorpio,</hi> about 4 Degrees near the place of <hi>Mercury,</hi> at the appearance of the New Star 1604, this doth declare that the Great of the Earth <hi>(viz.)</hi> Emperours, Kings, Princes, and chief Governours, ſhould adhere to the Counſel of thoſe men that endeavour to deſtroy both them and themſelves, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Mercury</hi> may be accounted for one that hath wit, yet being placed in <hi>Scorpio,</hi> at the appearance of that New Star ſhews him to be but of little honeſty, and <hi>Mercury</hi> alſo being in <hi>Scorpio,</hi> at the time of this <hi>Conjunction</hi> in <hi>Quartile,</hi> to the Conjunction it ſelf, and do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of <hi>Mars</hi> alſo, from whence may be conjectured, that a cunning ſort of People ſhall indeavour to poyſon the wholeſom Laws by bad Counſel, and fling the Governours of Kingdoms, Towns, and Cities, into eminent danger of Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>The firſt Aſpect the Sun meets with after the <hi>Conjunction,</hi> that is of note, is the Sextile of <hi>Mars;</hi> this will make thoſe Perſons ſignified by the Sun, to have great truſt in their Arms, <hi>Mars</hi> at the ſame time is in <hi>Quartile</hi> to the place of the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> 1663, and to the <hi>Quartile</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> at the appearance of the New Star 1604. I pray God in his mercy preſerve the City <hi>Gemini</hi> from being oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the Sword and all Martial actions; the next Aſpect the Sun meets withal is the <hi>Quartile</hi> both of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> this accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to natural cauſes ſhould afflict thoſe Perſons, ſignify'd by <hi>Sol</hi> in the Conjunction, with horrour and amazement, and ſhall be in danger of their Lives, Honour, and Eſtates, and be forced to fly for ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, for by bad advice they ſhall attempt to do that which they ſhall never attain to, by which means they ſhall bring themſelves and fame to deſtruction for ever, for the Sun is in a fixed Sign; let thoſe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42780:37"/>Perſons beware that have 10 or 11 degrees of <hi>Leo</hi> Aſcending, and <hi>Saturn</hi> 22 8 <hi>d. m.</hi> in <hi>Sagitarius,</hi> with the Sun 1.46 of <hi>Scorpio,</hi> I ſay let thoſe Perſons beware, for they have lately had the Sun Lord of their Aſcendant, Eclips'd upon the very degree Aſcending.</p>
            <p>And there has been alſo a Conjunction of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> upon the very degree Aſcending, and a Conjuction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> not far from the degree thereof, all theſe bring great ſorrow and Tribulation to theſe Natives then born, and to help forward, they have their mid-haven by direction to the Oppoſition of <hi>Saturn,</hi> this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the Honour and Reputation of all thoſe Perſons aforeſaid, if they be a Trades-man he cracks his Credit, and is in danger of a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he will likewiſe be in danger of being brought to publick Juſtice for ſome treaſonable practice that he hath committed, and if there be a Prince in <hi>Europe</hi> that was born under ſuch a poſition of Heaven, he ſhall go nigh to be in danger of his Life, by the wrath and Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the common ſort of Pople; in ſhort they will bend all their forces againſt him, and will reduce him to an Eſtate far below his Birth; the Oppoſition falls in <hi>Gemini,</hi> therefore let ſuch Perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of committing of Crimes in thoſe places under <hi>Gemini,</hi> for if they do they muſt expect to come to publick Juſtice let them think themſelves never ſo ſecure.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> is thought to have about 22 degrees of <hi>Scorpio,</hi> Aſcending in his Nativity, if ſo then is this <hi>Conjunction</hi> in <hi>Quartile</hi> to his Aſcendant, this will cauſe that mighty Monarch to be afflicted in his Body with Sickneſs if not Death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Norway</hi> is under <hi>Scorpio,</hi> the houſe of <hi>Mars,</hi> where <hi>Mercury</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily poſited, and the <hi>Conjunction</hi> it ſelf caſting a Square thereto, this ſhew the great misfortunes theſe People are like to endure by War, Uproars, Tumults, Ship-wrack, if not a great want of Grane.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Taurus,</hi> the Oppoſite Sign, is the <hi>Aſcendant</hi> of <hi>Ireland, Poland,</hi> and the North part of <hi>Sweedland,</hi> the <hi>Conjunction</hi> caſteth it's Square to it alſo, from whence thoſe places may expect to have a great Mortality, becauſe <hi>Taurus</hi> is upon the Cuſp of the 4th. and <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> both caſting their Square from the Cuſp of the 8th. and if we place <hi>Taurus</hi> upon the <hi>Aſcendant,</hi> then will the <hi>Conjunction</hi> fall in their 5th, and that doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>token Abortive Births, and ſome more than ordinary Monſtrous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, and that there ſhould be many Treaties, Embaſſies and Meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for Peace, all which are ſignified by the 5th.

            <p>
               <hi>Italy</hi> in general, and <hi>Rome</hi> in particular, are under <hi>Leo,</hi> the Sign in which this triple Conjunction falls, therefore will they be ſenſible in a high nature of the influence of this Conjunction; it denotes to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42780:38"/>them great Droughts and Barrenneſs of the Earth; as alſo, great Plagues they are threatned with, great Calamity by Fire, the Sword, Uproars, Tumults, Murthers, Grievous <hi>Contentions and Quarrelling,</hi> and depoſition of many Noble Princes and Rulers from their Honours and Dignities, without hope of reſtitution; Death and Deſtruction to others, <hi>Rome,</hi> many or moſt of them, theſe Enormities are threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; then certainly you Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> and alſo the <hi>Roman Pontifex,</hi> or Conclave of Cardinals of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> will all of you find great and moſt grievous Diſtempers in your Government, and ſo will many People and Nations be ſubject to the Fiery Triplicity. There ſhall alſo be great Rents and Schiſms amongſt the Religious Orders of Monks, Fryars, Jeſuits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo likewiſe ſhall there be amongſt thoſe of different Judgments, call them by what name you pleaſe; in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the Full Moon, preceding the firſt Conjunction, we find all the Planets above the Earth, the Moon excepted, this doth denote that what is pretended by this Conjunction, will break out in a ſhort time of the Conjunction it ſelf, upon the Cuſp of the 10th. Houſe, we find <hi>Scorpio</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> Lord thereof in the 8th. and the Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in <hi>Quartile</hi> to the very degree thereof. Now the 10th. Houſe ſignifies all Magiſtrates <hi>(viz.)</hi> Kings, Princes, Governours of Towns and Cities, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Majors, Bayliffs, all Captains and Conductors in War, likewiſe all Juſtices of the Peace, all theſe ſhall find great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their place and Office, ſome of them ſhall exerciſe Tyranny o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them they are to rule, and by that means cauſe their Subjects to rebel, and by that means bring themſelves and poſterity to great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, others of them will act beyond their Legal Power, and by that means bring themſelves under the laſh of the Law of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey wherein they live, and ſhall end their days by publick Juſtice, others they will end their days by Plagues, others will end their davs by Famine, and others by Gun-ſhot: In ſhort there will be a great rout of ſuch men, repreſented by the 10th. Houſe.</p>
            <p>Upon the Cuſp of the 11th. Houſe, we find <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and <hi>Mars</hi> caſting off his Square to <hi>Sagitarius</hi> out of the 8th. the Houſe of death.</p>
            <p>As to Kings and Rulers of Countries, the 11th. repreſents their Aſſociates, Councellors, Allies, their Treaſure, Ammunition, Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery, now <hi>Mars</hi> being Lord of the 10th, and being placed in the 8th. in Quartile, to the 11th. Houſe, from which may be conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the Princes of the Earth ſhould grow very ambitious, and ſhall waſt their Eſtates by War.</p>
            <p>If any one will be but pleaſed to inquire into Hiſtory, they will
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42780:38"/>find that the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> had its riſe under the Conjunction of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Scorpio,</hi> and that was 45 years before the coming of Chriſt, and by reaſon of there being a triple Conjunction in the Sign <hi>Leo</hi> in Quartile to the Conjunction that preceded the riſe of that Empire, from whence may be expected great calamity to befal that Empire, if not a final Cataſtrophe.</p>
            <p>About the year 1331, began the <hi>Ottomon</hi> Family, and that was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gubernation of a Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Gemini.</hi> Now is this Conjunction in <hi>Leo</hi> 1682, in Sextil to that <hi>Conjunction</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding the Riſe of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family, this ſhall cauſe that Monarch to thrive much, beſides he at this time hath very good directions in his Nativity; and foraſmuch as the <hi>Conjunction</hi> favours that mighty Prince, and afflicts the <hi>Roman Empire;</hi> therefore may it be conjectured that he ſhall diſmember the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> of ſome of his Territories; and ſhall continue ſo doing for ſome years.</p>
            <p>If we conſider the 9th. there we find <hi>Libra</hi> 21 degrees, and the Sun in the 9th in his fall oppoſed by the Moon Lady of the 7th. and <hi>Venus</hi> Lady of the 9th. has lately been in Quartile of <hi>Mars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 9th. ſignifies Religion, Pilgrimage, long Journeys or Voyages, Ceremonies, Sacrifices, Faith, Clergy-men of all Sorts, Arts, and Sciences, the Law, it alſo ſignifies learning in general, and all Church livings.</p>
            <p>That which is worth our taking notice of is the Comet that was ſeen in the Year 1680. when it came to be viſible over all <hi>Europe,</hi> it was in Quartile to the degree of the 9th. as if the beginning of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhould fall upon matters of Faith, from whence may be conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that there ſhall be great perſecution to thoſe that are of a contrary opinion, to thoſe that are eſtabliſhed by authority, even to the undoing of many thouſands, this Comet had its firſt appearance not far from the degrees of the 9th. and therefore all matters relating to the 9th. muſt ſuffer during the time of this <hi>Conjunction Operation,</hi> and for as much as the Comet was in <hi>Oppoſition</hi> of <hi>Saturn,</hi> when it appeared <hi>December</hi> 1680. ſhall there be great wrangling and great fewds, both about matters of Law, as of Divinity.</p>
            <p>If the Aſcendant repreſent the vulgar ſort of people, then doth the 2d. Houſe ſignifie their wealth, upon which we find <hi>Aquarius</hi> and the <hi>Dragons-Tail</hi> not far from thence, and both <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> are in <hi>Oppoſition</hi> to the ſecond alſo.</p>
            <p>Now the ſecond Houſe ſignifieth Riches, Eſtate, Goods of Fortune, Money, Plate, Houſhold-ſluſt, Corn, Jewels, and is the proper perſonal eſtate of any man. Now this <hi>Conjunction</hi> falling in <hi>Oppoſition</hi> to the ſecond Houſe, ſignifies there ſhould be but ſmall buying and ſelling, and as little enriching ones Eſtate. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, many ſhall much deſire it. I cannot but judg, from hence the ſudden undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of many a man by Rapine, Thievery, Taxes legal or illegal, there will great impoveriſhment to the Eſtates and Inheritance of the Nobility, to the Clergy, to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42780:39"/>the Gentleman, to the Lawyer and the induſtrious Merchant, and to the Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and hard labouring Farmer, the Diurnal operating Labourer, the Curious or Idle Mechanick, the Collier, Tinker, and the moſt ſordid of all Profeſſions, except the Hangman. To the <hi>Merchant</hi> I divine great loſs by Piracies, Shipwracks, and by broken Crediters, or Bankrupt Debtors: I cannot imagine by this <hi>Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> being in <hi>Oppoſiton</hi> to the ſecond, who, or what kind of man, or of what Nature and Profeſſion he ſhall be of, that in theſe Turbulent Times (as theſe are like to be for ſome years after the firſt <hi>Conjunction</hi>) ſhall either thrive or keep his own: And foraſmuch as the ſecond Houſe hath a fixed Sign on it, and the <hi>Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> it ſelf in a fixed Sign alſo, ſo ſhall be the means whereby men ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhed. He that is rich to day, is not certain to abound to morrow, he that kept Servants this month, may be a Servant or a Slave himſelf the next. An Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Poverty in Eſtate, in Cattel, Corn, and what not; a time uncomfortable I ſee, for ſome ſucceeding years, bad to all, good to few.</p>
            <p>If the tenth ſignifies Kings in general, you ſhall find <hi>Mars</hi> but in a dejected condition, in the 8th. and worſt of all, he is in <hi>Quartile</hi> to the 11th. that ſignifies the ſupport of Princes.</p>
            <p>With what difficulty, labour, and diſcontent, ſhall the Grandees of the World have to ſupply their neceſſary diſburſments for part of the years allotted to the concluſion of this <hi>Conjunction:</hi> In the next place if we make <hi>Jupiter</hi> the general Significator of the Nobility, Gentry, Epiſcopacy, Lawyers, Prelacy is from <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Munkery</hi> from <hi>Saturn;</hi> ſo that Cloiſters of Fryars, as well as Benefices of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, will ſmart, and come ſhort of their Revenues.</p>
            <p>If you will know by whom this ſhall be, <hi>Mars</hi> being Lord of the 10th. points Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and ſtrong-hand by the Souldiers, the <hi>Dragons-tail</hi> denoteth vulgar Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Clowns, day-labourers, Vagabond fellows, their own Tenants as forward as any body, for what either the Souldier Regal commands, or <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> leaves the Peaſant, will in time lay hold of the reſt. <hi>Guido Bonatus</hi> tells us, that if <hi>Jupiter</hi> be corporeally joyned to <hi>Saturn,</hi> men do their actions ſilently clocking all their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with Religion, with an appearance of Fidelity and Obſervation of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Juſtice, ſhall this Age be peſtered; with ſuch ſort of theſe men that ſhall pretend Juſtice and Law and rob men of their Rights and Eſtates, it will be ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Procus</hi> in <hi>Ptol.</hi> 71. <hi>fol.</hi> Tells us that an Artiſt is not ſatisfied in knowing whether the thing ſignified by a <hi>Conjunction,</hi> be good or bad, unleſs he know the Propriety or Quality <hi>(viz.)</hi> what manner of thing ſhall be good or evil, in the figure of the Full <hi>Moon</hi> preceding this <hi>Conjunction Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> hath the greateſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, and according to <hi>Cardanus Sig</hi> 4. <hi>Apho.</hi> 21. When two Planets rule, the Judgment ſhall be mixed and taken from them both, but when the Lord of the figure is joyned with him, or to either, he ſhall obtain principal Dominion. Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſignified by <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> ſhall give us the moſt eminent directions in our Judgment. I ſay then <hi>Saturn</hi> for his part, according to <hi>Eſcuidus</hi> fol. 13. hath ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to ſome matters already begun to Sects mutation, in the courſe of Worldly Kingdoms, and what-ever may require long time ere it be finiſhed; <hi>Saturn</hi> denoteth much decay in Trade, and Tillage, and Huſbandry, much loſs to thoſe that deal in <hi>Minerals,</hi> and ſo in <hi>Coal-Mines,</hi> Tin or Lead, for it's probable, either the Banks ſhall fall in, or elſe be over-flown with water, it alſo denoteth, that they ſhall have more Damps than formerly, which ſhall deſtroy a great many of the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, alſo great deſtruction to Fruits produced, or growing out of the Earth, or hindrance in ſuch Commodities that are got out of the Bowels of the Earth, many Towns and curious buildings ſhall be levelled with the ground, for the <hi>Conjunction</hi> is in <hi>Quartile</hi> to the 4th.

It pollutes the Body of Man with daily Diſeaſes, Conſumptions, dry Coughs, Moleſtation of the Humours, Fluxes, Quartan-Agues, Baniſhment by violence, great Poverty, Perplexities, Mournings, Fears poſſeſſeth the generality of Mankind; troubled Ayrs, thick Clouds, Darkneſs, plentiful Froſt and Snow, in the year 948. there was a Conjunction in <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Leo,</hi> and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the influence of this Conjunction, there was ſuch thick Clouds, that for ſix Months together, the Sun nor Moon did not ſhine, it was in the year of our Lord 966. It denotes alſo a very cold Seaſon, unſeaſonable Miſts and Fogs, many Apparitions in the Ayr, the colour of the Elements changed, the Skies many times varying from the former, had ſights of Armed Men, People in the night extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly frighted with thoſe like Viſions, when theſe or the like appear, or are more frequent than ordinary, <hi>(viz.)</hi> theſe ſtrange alterations in the Ayr, or in the Heavens; in what part of the Heavens theſe do ariſe, or where they firſt appear, or over what part of Heaven they centinue longeſt let thoſe places expect vengeance ſudcenly to follow or elſe why did they appear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rigel</hi> 87 <hi>Aphoriſ.</hi> tells us, Kindled vapours ſtreaming through the Ayr, whether in form of Comets or otherwiſe, points out hot Diſeaſes of an acute quality; as alſo Wars, and the diſſentions of Kingdoms, but running here and there and through all Parts, they demonſtrate an univerſal evil; if the appearance be more in one quarter of Heaven then another, in that eſpecially ſhall the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſignification be manifeſt, and not long after that, Famine or Scarcity.</p>
            <p>If we conſider the natural ſignification of <hi>Jupiter</hi> in this Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we ſhall find according to the opinion of all Authors, that he ſignifies naturally the Nobility of the beſt Rank and Quality, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the Law, Biſhops, and all ſorts of Clergy-men; as alſo Cities and Towns, Corporations, Subjects, Priviledges, Courts of Juſtice
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42780:40"/>obedience to Princes, Juſtice of Kings to their Subjects, Laws, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, Ordinances, Decrees; but in this Conjunction he principally looks upon the Gentry, becauſe he is Lord of the 11th. and in <hi>Leo,</hi> the houſe of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and is not far from the Cuſp of the 11th. from the 10th. I ſay all theſe ſorts of Men and things, muſt expect to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by this Conjuction, becauſe he is in Conjunction with this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Planet <hi>Saturn,</hi> in his detroment, and for as much as he is in Quartile to the Cuſp of the 10th. declares a deſention between ſome Prince of <hi>Europe</hi> and his Gentry, the more becauſe near the time of the Conjunction the <hi>Sun</hi> is in <hi>Scorpio,</hi> a haſting to a Quartile of the Conjunction it ſelf.</p>
            <p>All thoſe Laws that was confirmed, or had their original under the influence of the Conjunction in <hi>Aquares,</hi> the laſt time they were in the Airy Trygon, that is to ſay from the year, 1226. to the year, 1245. or from the year 1285. to the year 1307. or from the year 1344. to 1364. ſhall by the influence of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> now in <hi>Leo,</hi> be in danger of ſubverſion and utter ruin, and all thoſe Towns that had their original, or Corporations granted about thoſe times, ſhall be undone and impoveriſhed, and ſcarce have a face of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or elſe looſe both Town and Government at once, thoſe Laws, thoſe Conſtitutions, Courts of Juſtice, Common-wealths, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, Monerchies, Titles of Honour, or earthly Families and Names that had their beginning about the aforeſaid time, muſt expect to have great trouble and moleſtation, if not a final diſolution, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time alotted for this Conjunctions influence, and ſo much for the general Judgment of the Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter.</hi>

               <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Of the moſt Principal Times wherein the effects of this Conjunction will be manifeſted.</head>
            <p>THe method that I ſhall take to determine the time of the effects of this Conjunction is by directions, tranſits, leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Conjunctions and Aſpects of the Planets (eſpecially of the Superiours) alſo Eclipſes of the Luminaries and Comets that hath lately appeared, and doth opperate with this Conjunction, theſe do moſt certainly ſhew the perticular Times of the Events, all which as may be moſt neceſſary and beneficial for the young Students, I ſhall handle, not troubling him or my ſelf with Niceties.</p>
            <p>Theſe in themſelves are not only demonſtrative, and moſt rationally to be obſerved; but is alſo the Judgment of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Modern Aſtrologians; as may appear by theſe Aphoriſms following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ludoe de Rig. Alph.</hi> 44. In Engliſh is thus, not only by the revolution of the years of the World, or of a City, or of a Sect, may'ſt thou have the knowledge of future events; but it behoveth thee alſo to conſider the directions of thoſe Radixes or beginnings.</p>
            <p>And alſo in the 47 <hi>Aph.</hi> of the ſame Author, new evils are moved or ſtirred up in a City, when the direction cometh to the Quadrature or Oppoſition of the Infortunes, which if they be Retrograde, the evil will be the worſe.</p>
            <p>The 245 <hi>Aph.</hi> of <hi>Anonim</hi> in Engliſh is thus, in great Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Superiours, uſe directions that thou maiſt know the times of the grand mutations of Cities, and Countrys, and the 293 <hi>Aph.</hi> of the ſame Author he adviſeth us to uſe directions in the beginnings of Sect. that we may know the accidents attending, which is to be underſtood in all other Radixes.</p>
            <pb n="73" facs="tcp:42780:43"/>
            <p>Many more <hi>Aphoriſms</hi> might be produced to this purpoſe but I muſt haſten, note what hath been ſaid of the directions, is alſo as true in Aſpects and other configurations, according to that of <hi>Cardaneus,</hi> not only the Conjunctions of the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors; but alſo the Quadrate and Oppoſite Rayes or Aſpects do produce great nutations in the World.</p>
            <p>The method that I have uſed in directing of the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction 1603 and the New-Star 1604. Is according to <hi>Kepler</hi> who directs all the Planets in the Ecliptick, allowing the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a day for a year, and the Aſcendant and Mid-heaven of the Full-Moon after the Conjunction I have directed, allowing four minutes of time for a year, the ſame method have I uſed in the Full-Moon, preceeding the New-Star 1604.</p>
            <p>But the method that I have uſed in the leſſer Conjunctions of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> is the ſame that we uſe in Revolutions of Nativities that is to allow the time between the Aſcendant of the Lunation preceeding the Conjunction, and the Aſcendant of the Lunation of the Conjunction following, to be the meaſure of time for the year between the two Conjunctions, let be 19 or 20 years, as has been already ſhewed in the Diſcourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore going, now follows the Judgment of the ſeveral years his Conjunction is allowed to opperate.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IN this year that hath been ſo pointed at by the Antients, the Aſcendant of the Conjunction 1603. comes to the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Conjunction it ſelf, and the Mid-heaven to the Trine of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Mercury;</hi> comes alſo to the Sextile of the <hi>Sun</hi> and Trine of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and Sextile of <hi>Venus;</hi> theſe are notable directions, and will have as motable accidents to attend them; the Oppoſition of the Conjunction falls in <hi>Gemini,</hi> thoſe places that are under that Sign, ſhall find great alterations both in matter of Trade, much affliction to the common People in general, a Plague or ſome Diſtemper as bad will deſtroy a great part of their Inhabitants, all things goes croſs with them, an Inſurrection is feared, the Magiſtrates grows Tyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical and prove unjuſt in moſt of their Actions, the People grow weary of their Burdens, and are inclinable to Rebellion, the Gentry of thoſe Kingdoms under <hi>Gemini,</hi> are alſo much afflicted both in their Body and Eſtate, ſome of them will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Impriſonment, others Death, in ſhort, a change may be expected this year in thoſe places under <hi>Gemini;</hi> we have alſo the <hi>Sun</hi> in the Figure of the New-Star directed to the Quartile of <hi>Mars,</hi> Lord of the 4th. Houſe, and the <hi>Sun</hi> is Lord of the 12th. in that Figure now ſhall thoſe Villanies that has lain hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den for many years, break out, and ſhew themſelves in their proper Colours.</p>
               <p>The Quartile falls in <hi>Capricorn,</hi> the Aſcendant of <hi>Oxford,</hi> I pray God that City may not be afflicted; the Heavens points ſomething more then ordinary ſhould befall that place, and all the places under <hi>Capricorn</hi> and <hi>Cancer;</hi> for the Moon meets
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42780:44"/>with the Quartile of <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>Cancer,</hi> her own Houſe, alſo at the ſame time: ſhall <hi>Holland</hi> be free from trouble? No; for <hi>Mars</hi> is a ſtirer up of Sedition and War, a ſuddain fear will poſſeſs that people of another Invaſion. Likewiſe they ſhall ſuffer great loſſes by Inundation of Water; the Mid-heaven of the New star meets with the Quartile of <hi>Mercury,</hi> the Quartile falls in <hi>Leo</hi> upon the Cuſp of the 12th. Now if the Mid-heaven Repreſents all Kings and Magiſtrates, then thoſe ſhall find great trouble in thoſe Countrys under <hi>Leo;</hi> the 12th. is the 3d. from the 10th. <hi>(viz.)</hi> Kings and their Kindred ſhall diſagree, the New Star 1604. meets by direction the Quartile of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> 1603. Now this New Star (by the conſent of Antients) is thought to be the forerunner of an univerſal Monarch, that ſhall be upon the Earth, which can never be without having a great deal of War and Bloodſhed. Firſt, therefore ſhall this Quartile excite mens minds to War and Contention to the utter Deſtruction of moſt of theſe Monarchs now in being, in thoſe places under <hi>Piſces</hi> where the Quartile falls, and <hi>Mars</hi> the place of the New Star and the great conjunction, and <hi>Gemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi> the oppoſite ſigne, and <hi>Virgo</hi> the oppoſite ſigne to the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile; will be the Places moſt ſubject to the effects of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
               <p>In the year 1683 <hi>January.</hi> About the latter end, there is another Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and the New <hi>Moon</hi> before that the <hi>Sun</hi> ſuffer an Eclips near the Cuſp of the 9th. and <hi>Saturu</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> both of them oppoſe the 9th. alſo; this ſhews that Religion ſhall ſuffer much this year, and ſo ſhall the Clergy in general; it doth preſage publick forrow to the Gentry, or men of the higheſt Rank, thoſe places under <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, Leo, Scorpio</hi> and <hi>Taurus,</hi> will be ſubject moſt to the effects of this Eclips, the <hi>Moon</hi> alſo ſuffers an Eclips on the firſt of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> about three a clock in the afternoon, upon the Cuſp of the ſecond Houſe, in 23 Degrees of <hi>Leo;</hi> at which time <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> are in the Aſcendant; this foreſhews the loſs of the great Cattle, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Horſes and Cows, becauſe the <hi>Moon</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:42780:45"/>is Lady of the 12th. the Vulger People ſhall have great loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as to their movables; for which they ſhall grow diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and ſhall be deſirous of changing of their Laws and Governours, in hopes thereby to better themſelves; there will be alſo a ſecond Eclips of the <hi>Moon,</hi> on the 28th. day of <hi>July,</hi> at eight in the morning, at which time the <hi>Sun, Saturn</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> will all of them be in the 11th. and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> haſts to the Quartile of <hi>Mars,</hi> the Eclips falls in the 5th. and doth declare the ill ſucceſs of Embaſſadours, the abortion of Women with Child, it alſo declares ſome ſtrange Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophe or change to happen in thoſe places under <hi>Aquares; Leo, Scorpio,</hi> and <hi>Taurus.</hi>

               <p>IN this year the mid-heaven of the Conjunction comes by direction to the Sextile of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and the new Star comes by direction to the Quartile of the great <hi>Conjunction</hi> 1603; and <hi>Jupiter</hi> alſo comes to the Quartile of the great <hi>Conjunction,</hi> much about this time; theſe are alſo notable directions, and will be attended with at great events. The mid-heavens to the Sextile of <hi>Mercury,</hi> doth declare, that the Governours of thoſe Countreys under <hi>Aquarius</hi> ſhould thrive, and get Renown. The <hi>Sweed</hi> now at this time is inclinable to Peace, and it is beſt for him ſo to do, for if he ſlips this opportunity, he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent when it is too late.

The firſt is an Eclypſe of the Moon <hi>April</hi> the 5th, at 6 of the Clock at night, in 26 of <hi>Libra.</hi> The ſecond is an Eclypſe of the Sun <hi>April</hi> 21. 1 of the Clock in the Morning, in 11 degrees of <hi>Taurus.</hi> The third will be an Eclypſe of the Moon <hi>September</hi> 30. at 10 of the Clock in the Morning, in 17 degrees of <hi>Aries.</hi> All theſe three being not viſible. The fourth is an Eclypſe of the Sun, the 15th. day at 7 of the Clock in the Morning, in 2 degrees of <hi>Scorpio,</hi> upon the very degree of the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars.</hi> The <hi>November</hi> following, from all theſe Configurations may be judged, that <hi>Italy</hi> ſuffers much, and will be inforced to mourn, becauſe of the ſorrow that ſhe doth undergo, <hi>Auſtria</hi> is alſo afflicted by <hi>Saturn,</hi> being in her Sign, and will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42780:50"/>any good ſhould be done unto her; ſhall that Prince be always troubled with that Party <hi>(viz.)</hi> Jeſuits that lead him by the noſe to his own Deſtruction? no, the Eclipſe of the Sun in <hi>Scorpio,</hi> and the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> upon the degree of the Eclypſe, will ſhare their Crowns for them, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> hold up their Heads a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle longer, the <hi>Bavarians</hi> loſe their Honours, the <hi>Turk</hi> will be much afflicted with Domeſtick broyls and Foreign Loſſes, the <hi>Bohemians</hi> are very much diſreſpected, but alſo poor <hi>Ireland</hi> I fear will have cauſe to groan for the lamentable Maſſacres ſhe doth undergo.

               <p>Had not <hi>Jupiter</hi> been ſo weak in <hi>Capricornus</hi> at the time of the 2d.

               <p>The judgment of this year differs but little from the laſt. <hi>Bohemia</hi> is afflicted with a ſcarcity of Grain and other Proviſion fit for Food.

               <p>IN this Year we have no Directions of the great <hi>Conjunction,</hi> nor of the New Star 1604, that are conſiderable; therefore we look to the other Configurations of the Planets and Eclypſes. We have a famous Oppoſition of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars, Saturn</hi> being in 8 degrees of <hi>Capricornus,</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> 8 degrees in <hi>Cancer,</hi> it falls on the 12th. of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> There are four Eclypſes this Year.

The ſecond will be of the Sun on the firſt of <hi>June</hi> at 5 of the Clock at Night, in 21 degrees of <hi>Gemini,</hi> the Aſcendant of <hi>London,</hi> and viſible.
